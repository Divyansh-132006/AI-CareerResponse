The person already has the following skills:${skills}.

Instructions:

2. Number each step explicitly in this format: Step 1:, Step 2:, Step 3:, etc.
3. Each step should be clear, concise, and actionable (avoid vague suggestions).
4. Cover essential phases such as foundational knowledge, advanced skills, practical projects, certifications, portfolio building, networking, and job preparation.
5. If applicable, include estimated timeframes for each step (e.g., 2-3 months).
6. Use simple and professional language, suitable for direct display in a text interface.

Return only the roadmap, nothing else.;
